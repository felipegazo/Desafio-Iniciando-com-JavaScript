# Explore Without Limits

This project is a simple web application designed to introduce basic JavaScript concepts and functionalities through interactive prompts and alerts. Users will engage in various arithmetic operations, type checking, and conditional statements.

## Features
- User Interaction: Prompts users to input numbers and displays results through alerts.
- Arithmetic Operations: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on user-provided numbers.
- Parity Check: Determines if the sum of two numbers is even or odd.
- Type Checking: Verifies the type of given variables (number, string, boolean).

## Detailed Explanation
User Interaction:

The user is greeted with an alert displaying "Hello World!".
The user is then prompted to input two numbers, which are stored in number1 and number2.

Arithmetic Operations:

The application calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.
Results are displayed through alerts.

Parity Check:

The application checks if the sum of the two numbers is even or odd and informs the user accordingly.
It also verifies if the sum is not odd.

Type Checking:

The application checks the type of three variables (isANumber, isAString, isBoolean) and alerts the user whether they are of type number, string, or boolean.
